# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
During this project, we were tasked with assisting an employee of the Colorado board of elections, Tom, to find a more efficient and faster way to use Python to analyze count data such as mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic, to be able to select the new congressman. In order to achieve this goal without any problem, we were told certain key points to analyze and detail to achieve a better result. These key points are:

1. Get the total number of votes cast.
2. Get the complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Get the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. Get the total number of votes each candidate won.
5. Announce the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
The resources we used for this analysis were:

- The total number of votes as well as their percentage for each county as presented below, shows that the county with the largest number of votes is Denver.

  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

The three candidates along with their number of votes and the percentage of the total votes received as shown below demonstrates that the winner of the election is Diana DeGette. With a total number of votes of 272.892 and a total percentage of votes of 73.8%, candidate DeGette outperformed her competitors by more than doubling their results.

- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Shown below we share a picture of the final results also indicated in the election analysis text file resulting from running the VS Code.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges we faced during the analysis and collection of this data were to be able to read and write a CSV file in the VS Code editor and be able to code in a simple, understandable, and effective way all the information we had in a short period of time. It was important that the indentitation be correct and that was problematic in getting the work done smoothly. 

## Election-Audit Summary

The analysis can be used a short stop review for all elections a few minutes after an election is closed to gauge the turnout, compared to registered voters, get an idea of the winner and the top candidate while confirmation is pending until validation of the prelimiary results. 
Results involve the manipulation of large data. so having a program to run and understand the numbers is a good tool for in election management.  In countries where elections are subject to disputes, this analysis can also be used to plan for disagreement in advance
